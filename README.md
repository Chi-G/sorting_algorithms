## 0x1B. C - Sorting algorithms & Big O

## General objectives
* To know at least four different sorting algorithms
* To know what the ``Big O notation`` is, and how to evaluate the ``time complexity`` of an ``algorithm``
* To know how to select the best sorting algorithm for a given input
* To know what ``stable sorting algorithm`` is

## General Requirements
- Allowed editors: ``vi``, ``vim``, ``emacs``
- All files was compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options ``-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89``
- All files end with a new line
- There is a README.md file at the root of the folder of the project
- The codes used the ``Betty`` style, and were checked using [betty-style.pl](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/blob/master/betty-style.pl) and [betty-doc.pl](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/blob/master/betty-doc.pl)
- Global variables were not allowed
- No more than 5 functions per file
- The prototypes of all functions used are included in the header file called ``sort.h``
- All header files are include guarded
- A list/array does not need to be sorted if its size is less than 2.
